<!-- ABOUT -->

## About

PeakEater is a free, easy-to-use wave-shaping plugin. PeakEater lets you choose between different [wave-shaping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveshaper) [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) to clip everything above ceiling level. Therefore, you can boost the overall volume of your track safely without worrying that some nasty peak would go above the maximum allowed volume level of your DAW. It supports various <a href="#features">features</a> such as multiple clipping types, oversampling and visualizations of a clipping process that aims to make clipping easy and fun.

## Features

### RMS Meters

<img src="assets/screenshots/screenshot-in.png" alt="input-rms-screen" height="250"/><---><img src="assets/screenshots/screenshot-out.png" alt="output-rms-screen" height="250"/>

See how loud the signal was before and after the plugin.

### Input & Output Gain

<img src="assets/screenshots/screenshot-in-gain.png" alt="input-gain-screen" height="100"/><---><img src="assets/screenshots/screenshot-out-gain.png" alt="output-gain-screen" height="100"/>

Adjusts gain level before and after processing. Input Gain is useful when you're either working with too quiet or too loud a signal and Output Gain can be helpful to compensate for loss of gain.

### Link Input with Output

<img src="assets/screenshots/screenshot-link.png" alt="link-in-out" height="100"/>

Use linking to automatically set the Output Gain level to the opposite of the Input Gain. For example, if the Input Gain value is set to +5dB then the Output Gain value will be automatically set to -5dB and vice versa.

### Ceiling control

<img src="assets/screenshots/screenshot-ceiling-knob.png" alt="link-in-out" height="100"/>

Control your ceiling. Everything above this level would be "eaten". Build-in RMS meter would show you the signal level that comes into the clipper and help you set the threshold.

### Visualizer

<img src="assets/screenshots/screenshot-clip-visualizer.png" alt="clip-visualizer" height="100"/>

Displays magnitude(in dB's) so you can see how peaks were eaten over time.

### Analyzer

<img src="assets/screenshots/screenshot-analyzer.png" alt="clip-analyzer" height="100"/>

Shows approximated RMS that was cut ("Eaten") in the last 2 seconds and current clipping algorithm. Double-click on numbers to drop them to zero and force them re-calculate.

### Configurable Tick marks

<img src="assets/screenshots/screenshot-switch-ticks.gif" alt="switch-db-level-scales" width="400"/>

Right-Mouse-Click on Visualizer to switch between different tick marks.

## Configurable Scaling

<img src="assets/screenshots/screenshot-scaling.gif" alt="switch-db-level-scales" width="400"/>

Also, you can switch between linear and non-linear scaling.

### 6 Clipping Types

<img src="assets/screenshots/screenshot-clip-type.png" alt="clip-type" height="100"/>

Choose between 6 clipping functions, from Hard clipping to different types of Soft Clip (Up to Arctangent).
Available clipping functions are:

- Hard
- Quintic
- Cubic
- Tangent
- Algebraic
- Arctangent

You can read more about the difference between Hard and Soft clipping [here](https://www.hackaudio.com/digital-signal-processing/distortion-effects/hard-clipping/) and [here](https://www.hackaudio.com/digital-signal-processing/distortion-effects/soft-clipping/).

### Oversampling

<img src="assets/screenshots/screenshot-oversample.png" alt="oversample" height="100"/>

Choose between 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x and 32x oversampling to avoid signal aliasing. You can also turn off oversampling.

> **Note** High values of oversampling may hurt CPU performance.

You can read more about oversampling [here](https://www.nickwritesablog.com/introduction-to-oversampling-for-alias-reduction/).

### <a id="dry-wet"></a> Dry/Wet

<img src="assets/screenshots/dry-wet.gif" alt="drywet" height="200"/>

Control mix between original and clipped signal. Useful when the clipper is used as an exciter.

### Bypass mode

<img src="assets/screenshots/screenshot-bypass.png" alt="bypass" height="100"/>

Bypasses all plugin's processing. Useful when you need to make side-by-side comparisons before and after processing.

### Resizing

<img src="assets/screenshots/screenshot-resize.png" alt="bypass" height="100"/>

Drag the corner to change the size of the window.

### VST3, AU, LV2 and CLAP support

<img src="assets/vendorIcons/vst3.png" alt="vst3" height="50"/> <img src="assets/vendorIcons/audio-units.png" alt="au" height="50"/> <img src="assets/vendorIcons/lv2.png" alt="lv2" height="50"/> <img src="assets/vendorIcons/clap.png" alt="clap" height="50"/>

You can use either VST3, AU (macOS only), LV2 or CLAP type of plugin.

> **Warning** LV2 and CLAP support is experimental and may be unstable.

### Available on all major platforms

<img src="assets/vendorIcons/macOS.png" alt="macOS" height="30"/> <img src="assets/vendorIcons/windows.png" alt="windows" height="30"/> <img src="assets/vendorIcons/linux.png" alt="linux" height="30"/>

You can use it on macOS, Windows or Linux.

> **Warning** Linux support is experimental and may be unstable.

### <a id="verified-by-pluginval"></a> Verified by Pluginval <img src="assets/pluginval.png" alt="Pluginval" height="20"/>

> pluginval is a cross-platform plugin validator and tester application. It is designed to be used by both plugin and host developers to ensure stability and compatibility between plugins and hosts. [GitHub Project Link](https://github.com/Tracktion/pluginval/tree/develop)

VST3 and AU versions are verified by [Tracktion Pluginval](https://www.tracktion.com/develop/pluginval) for all platforms. Maximum possible strictness level 10 is used. For macOS and Linux - Headless Mode is being used and GUI Mode is used for Windows. Starting from v0.6.5, you may find proofs of Pluginval verification in the "Assets" section on the Release page(\*.txt files are split by platform and plugin format).

<!-- INSTALLATION -->

## Installation

1. Go to <a href="https://github.com/vvvar/PeakEater/releases/latest"><b>the latest release</b></a> page.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Building from sources

#### Prerequisites

- [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) 1.13.0+
- [Python](https://www.python.org) 3.11.4+
- [Brew](https://brew.sh) 4.0.23+(macOS only)
- [C++ Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022)(Windows only)
- [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) 1.4.0+(Windows only)

> **Note**<br />
> It is recommended to use PowerShell on Windows

### Building

```sh
just setup
just build
```

Build artifacts will be stored in the `/build/Release/peakeater_artefacts`.

### Code signing on macOS

By default, code signing is turned **off**. To enable it:

1. Make sure you have a valid [Apple Developer ID](https://developer.apple.com/support/developer-id/), [Apple Team ID](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/77563) and your signing certificate installed on your Mac(Use [this guide](https://melatonin.dev/blog/how-to-code-sign-and-notarize-macos-audio-plugins-in-ci/) as a starting point. Be aware - they are **not free**)

2. Create a file called `.env` with the following content(replace the value with your Apple Developer ID, Apple ID, password from your Apple ID and Team ID):

```env
MACOS_APPLE_DEVELOPER_ID="Developer ID Application: John Doe (XXXXX6XX42)"
MACOS_APPLE_ID="johndoe@gmail.com"
MACOS_APPLE_PASSWORD="jhnd-oejh-ndoe-jhnn"
MACOS_APPLE_TEAM_ID="JHNDO6E642"
```

3. Setup the `notarytool`(used to notarize DMG):

```sh
just setup-notarytool
```

You should see something like this in the terminal:

```
xcrun notarytool store-credentials "APPLE_SIGN_PROFILE" --apple-id $MACOS_APPLE_ID --password $MACOS_APPLE_PASSWORD --team-id $MACOS_APPLE_TEAM_ID

This process stores your credentials securely in the Keychain. You reference these credentials later using a profile name.

Validating your credentials...
Success. Credentials validated.
Credentials saved to Keychain.
To use them, specify `--keychain-profile "APPLE_SIGN_PROFILE"`
```

After this just run the build. CMake will automatically sign all binaries.
